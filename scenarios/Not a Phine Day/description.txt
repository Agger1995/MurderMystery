*DRINK* as the whisky ran down my throat I felt better but more is necessary to cope with this.
*DRINK* Better, but damn I need more.
*DRINK* Finally, the whisky is taking its toll on my body and I had to go to the bathroom. 
I walk towards the bathroom in desperate need, only to find a dead body in the middle of the bathroom, smeared in blood, it appears to be Mr. Phein’s daughter Agnes.
The room was empty, growing cold, dark and silent except for the faint shock in my mind.
I will find the monster who did this, this is too gruesome to let be.
