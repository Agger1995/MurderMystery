UNUSED
Such a shame, Agnes known for her beauty resembling from her mother, now had a face with multiple cuts. A bit of dust is around her face, could be anything from flour to baby powder *sniff* hmm some sort of poison, fits the case, it has a very distinctive smell.

A bottle of whiskey on the floor in hallway on the 1st floor, who could be leaving such a beauty there? *drink* ahh… that’s the stuff. Oh, better get back to work, otherwise I’ll be spending all my time here. I’ll take it with me for later.

bloody knife
true
You pick up the bloody knife.
A knife wrapped in a handkerchief soaked in blood... in Mr. Phein’s room... the knife seems to also have some powder on it. It looks like the same powder as the one on the body. *sniff*, yeah this is ratpoison. Odd to find something like that in his room, I wonder who dropped this here. Better bring it with me.

rat poison
true
You pick up the rat poison.
Odd to find an empty bottle of rat poison in the kitchen, the powdery substance matches the one found by the body. The amount is rather small to cause the murder. *Sniff* ratpoison, I can always tell, ratpoison has a very distinct smell. I definitely should bring this with me.

golf club
true
You pick up a golf club.
A golf club in the garden, doesn’t seems suspicious so far. There is no blood on it, and it seems to be clean and shiny, yet it has been left alone in the garden. I do like golf, maybe I should “confiscate the evidence” and inconspicuously bring this back home.

rope
true
You pick up a rope.
A rope with a tied knot, not usually something you’d find in a hallway on the 2nd hall. Perhaps someone were trying to off themselves out of guilt. Only Agnes and Mr. Phein lives here. Interesting case, we better include this one.

You pick up a pistol.
Finding a pistol in the library, odd place to find a pistol. All bullets are still in the case, but no bullets or gunpowder were found by the scene. It didn’t seem to have caused the murder, yet I’m gonna have to add this one, I can’t have the murderer using this on me.
