The previous case even after 5 years the mystery still lingers in my memory. As for her dad, he went, as predicted, to jail serving a sentence for the rest of his life. Still he got, well, what he deserved but still a feeling of contempt and disdain for him, both his motive and his actions, renders in my mind still. I might be a snarky guy trying spice up the mood of any game, but this was reaching the end of my patience.

I wish, even though it’s a terrible wish, that a mystery was to appear, not necessarily here, but somewhere different from that mansion.

As I thought that ironically, a gunshot was heard by the far end of the bar. A shadow escapes the bar and my vision is blurred eventually turning black. Perhaps I had to much to drink, is the last thought I had before waking up in the bar, everyone is still there and a fellow detective has arrived at the scene. I tell her to not call the police. She tells me, that she gives me 1.5 hours to try to solve this murder, using the people and items left behind. Any longer than that and the trail will go cold.

And so a mystery begins, you are in the favourite room of our favourite detective 5 years into the future of our previous scenario (Murder in the Mansion) and 15 mins after the current murder happened. This time you only have ONE room to explore, you have to solve the mystery by asking the people around you and inspecting the items, finding the murder weapons. In order to win the game, you will need to figure out who the accomplice is, since the murderer is long gone.

Good luck, this time you’ll need time! Hint: There’s a friendly midget in the bathroom, it might not make sense, but trust me on this one. *WINK* *WINK*
