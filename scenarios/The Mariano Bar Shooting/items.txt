drink
true
You pick up the drink.
The drink is lovely at a time like this, happy for once that the murder happened at a bar. All of the sudden, I landed in the bathroom. The power of the drink, I suppose, better get back to the case.

Who the hell has a diskoball in 2016? Well, it’s crashed on the floor, I don’t think it has any relevance. I’m drunk though, so it could be fun to carry around, suit yourself.

Hmm a fallen chair by the door. Maybe I could collect fingerprints using tape. Glad that I conveniently carry it around for such purposes. Alright, now all I need is a fingerprint repertoire. Oh well, guess I’ll keep it anyways.
