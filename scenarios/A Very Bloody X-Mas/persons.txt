Charlie Specter
true
visit a friend
blood in the kitchen
rumor say Ezra killed his son
the murder is solved, on this bloody X-mas.you did it with grace and pride and quickness. you: “Now the heavy day is over, leave Steve's body’s coloured pride underneath the grass and clover, with his feet laid side by side. Did the kiss of Mother Mary Put that music in his face? Yet she goes with footstep wary, Full of earth's old timid grace.” now it’s time to go to bed, forget this sad and awful day,tomorrow another case is led. this was success, that's what they say.

my first name’s charlie but call me Mr. Specter. i work with treasures i´m a real collector. i came tonight to visit a friend. but then tonight a life would end.
i was in the livingroom when the cry was heard. i was shocked when they ran i was lost for words. i went to the kitchen to gather my thoughts, and that's where i found some bloody red spots
you've heard of the man they call Erza Scrooge. they tell the stories, and his sins are huge i can't really say but i pains me so. they say he killed his son, named joe.
