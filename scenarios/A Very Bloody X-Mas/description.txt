Once upon a time a dark Christmas Eve.
a house was abandoned they choose to leave.
within a year a new family came.
they fixed the place, it was all the same.
Christmas came, and christmas went.
Within a year it was there again.
A party was held, a big one indeed.


The party turned red and someone was dead.
A murder indeed, someone did bleed.
Your job is now to solve the case.
Who is the murderer, in this christmas haze?
